### What is it?
<p align="left">Ucheat is a command line utility for displaying the keybindings on a window manager, custom or not. It has the capability to display all kinds,
and even with psuedo syntax highlighting. It functions similarly to the cheatsheets built into window managers such as Awesome, or XMonad.</p>

### How does it work?
<p align="left">It basically checks for a window manager config file, and greps any applicable information within it. Currently, it has support for i3, and qtile. I hope to add functionality for other WM's as well.</p>
