Ucheat: (Written by Alden Garcia)
A command line utility that greps any applicable information from someones
WM, and generates a widespread custom cheatsheet for one's keybindings.

	Program Todo:
	- Figure out a way to actually colorize text.
	- Discard the BSPWM cheatsheet I find a way to make it function properly.
	- Add a seperate file for selecting if a user wants a fixed cheatsheet,
	or a dynamically updating one.

	Github Todo:
	- Actually write a readme.md.
	- Write the wiki, and install guide stuff.
	- Update the about section. (Emojis, and such.)
